# advdev-tekejane
Project Milestone 1

1.   Create a version-controlled GitHub repository for your project. Name it according to the course naming convention (e.g., advdev-yourname). This step is actually optional, as it allows you to practice having your project in an online repository. But if you aren’t familiar with how Git works, then you can skip this step. If you are interested in learning how to place your project in version control using Git and GitHub, then visit the following link to see how to apply them in VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github

2.   Set up a new Django project and application using best practices for folder structure and naming. This should include:

A top-level project folder (manage.py, settings.py, etc.)
An app folder (e.g., main/)
3.   Define at least two static routes using URLconf, each linked to a dedicated view and template:

 A home page (e.g., /) that uses a base template
A static “About” page or similar informative content
4.   Create a base HTML template and use Django’s template inheritance mechanism to extend it in your static views.

5.   Verify that your views render correctly in the browser and demonstrate both static content and the use of template logic (e.g., placeholder variables or tags).

 

Tips:

Use the Django documentation as a reference when configuring your settings and URL mappings.
Avoid jumping ahead to database models or forms as these will be added in future weeks.
Think of your project structure now as the backbone for all future development.
By the end of this milestone, your application should have:

A working Django setup
Two views linked via URLconf
Two templates with shared layout using template inheritance
A live server viewable in the browser
